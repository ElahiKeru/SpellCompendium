        <effect>Material: A bit of sponge
You draw the moisture from every creature in a 30-foot cube centered on a point you choose within range. Each creature in that area must make a Con save. Constructs and Undead are not affected, and plants and water elementals make this saving throw with disadvantage. A creature takes 12d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Nonmagical plants in the area that aren't creatures, such as trees and shrubs, wither and die instantly.</effect>

The spell captures some of the incoming energy, lessening its effect on you and storing it for your next melee attack. You have resistance to the triggering damage type until the start of your next turn. Also, the first time you hit with a melee attack on your next turn, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of the triggering type, and the spell ends.

You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20 foot cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a tiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that won't set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is mental or audible. A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you're sleeping. An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within 60 feet.</effect>

        <effect>You assume a different form. When you cast the spell, choose one of the following options, the effects of which last for the duration of the spell. While the spell lasts, you can end one option as an action to gain the benefits of a different one.
Aquatic Adaptation: You adapt your body to an aquatic environment, sprouting gills and growing webbing between your fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.
Change Appearance: You transform your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, and body features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can also make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your statistics change. You also can't appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you're bipedal, you can't become quadrupedal. At any time for the duration of the spell you can use your action to change your appearance in this way again.
Natural Weapons: You grow claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage as appropriate to the natural weapon you choose, and you are proficient with your unarmed strikes. Finally, the natural weapon is magic and you have a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls you make using it.</effect>

This spell lets you convince a beast that you mean it no harm. Choose a beast you can see within range. It must see and hear you. If the beast's intelligence is 4 or higher, the spell fails. Otherwise, the beast must succeed on a Wisdom save or be charmed by you for the spell's duration. If you or one of your companions harms the target, the spell ends.

        <effect>Material: a morsel of food.
By means of this spell, you use an animal to deliver a message. Choose a tiny beast you can see within range, such as a squirrel, a blue jay, or a bat. You specify a location, which you must have visited, and a recipient who matches a general description, such as "A man or woman dressed in the uniform of the town guard." You also speak a message of up to 25 words. The target beast travels for the duration of the spell towards the specified location, covering about 50 miles per 24 hours for a flying messenger, or 25 miles for terrestrials.
When the messenger arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that you described, replicating the sound of your voice. The messenger speaks only to the creature matching the description you gave. If the messenger doesn't reach its destination before the spell ends, the message is lost, and the beast makes its way back to where you cast this spell.

        <effect>Your magic turns others into beasts. Choose any number of willing creatures that you can see within range. You transform each target into the form of a Large or smaller beast with a challenge rating of 4 or lower. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to transform affected creatures into new forms.
The transformation lasts for the duration for each target, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. You can choose a different form for each target. A target's game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast, though the target retains its alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form takes on the HP it was at before transforming. If it reverts as a result of hitting 0 HP any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 HP, they aren't knocked unconscious. The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak or cast spells.
The target's gear melds into the new form. The target can't wield, activate, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.</effect>

        <effect>Material: A drop of blood, a piece of flesh, and a pinch of bone dust.
The spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a medium or small humanoid within range. Your spell imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones and a zombie if you chose a corpse (DM has the statistics).
On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.
The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you give it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell again before the current 24 hour period elapses. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one.
Higher Spell Levels: +2 targets per spell level over 3rd (both for initial animation and reasserting control). Each must come from a different source.</effect>

Medium targets count as two objects, Large targets count as four objects, Huge targets count as eight objects. You can't animate any object larger than Huge. Each target animates and becomes a creature under your control until the spell ends or until reduced to O hit points.
As a bonus action, you can mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is
within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.
ANIMATED OB/ECT STATISTICS
Size  | HP | AC | Attack                     | Strength | Dexterity
Tiny  | 20 | 18 | +8 to hit, 1d4 + 4 damage  |  4  | 18
5mall | 25 | 16 | +6 to hit, ld8 + 2 damage  |  6  | 14

Huge  | 80 | 10 | +8 to hit. 2d12 + 4 damage | 18  |  6
An animated object is a construct with AC, hit points, attacks, Strength, and Dexterity determined by its size. Its Constitution is 10 and its Intelligence and Wisdom are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed is 30 feet; if the object lacks legs or other appendages it can use for locomotion, it instead has a f1yingspeed of 30 feet and can hover. If the object is securely attached to a surface or a larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is O. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond that distance. When the animated object drops to O hit points, it reverts to its original object form, and any remaining damage carries over to its original object form.
If you command an object to attack, it can make a single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. It makes a slam attack with an attack bonus and bludgeoning damage determined by its size. The DM might rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or piercing damage based on its form.
At Higher Levels: +2 targets per spell level over 5th.</effect>

        <effect>Material: a pinch of powdered iron or iron filings.
A 10 foot radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds you. This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can't be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.
Spells and other magical effects except those created by an artifact or a deity are suppressed in the sphere and cannot protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is still consumed. While an effect is suppressed it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.
Targeted Effects: Spells and other magical effects, such as Magic Missile that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.
Areas of Magic: The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.
Spells: Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.
Magic Items: The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword. A magic weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits. 
Magical Travel: Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere. 
Creatures and Objects: A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.
Dispel Magic: Spells and magical effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different antimagic field spells don't nullify each other.

        <effect>Material: Either a lump of alum soaked in vinegar for the antipathy effect or a drop of honey for the sympathy effect.
This spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice. You target something within range, either a huge or smaller object or creature or an area that is no larger than a 200 foot cube. Then specify a kind of intelligent creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose antipathy or sympathy as the aura's effect.
Antipathy: The enchantment causes creatures of the kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the target. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened. The creature remains frightened while it can see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened by the target, the creature must use its movement to move to the nearest safe spot from which it can't see the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and can't see it, the creature is no longer frightened, but can become so affected again if it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.
Sympathy: The enchantment causes the specified creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target while within 60 feet of it or able to see it. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom save or use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target. When the creature has done so, it can't willingly move away from the target. If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected creature can make a Wisdom save to end the effect.
Ending the Effect: If an affected creature ends its turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, the creature makes a Wisdom save. On success, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected by the spell is allowed another Wisdom save every 24 hours while the spell persists. A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which it can be affected again.</effect>

You create an invisible magical eye within range that hovers in the air for the duration.

As an action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction. There is no limit to how far away from you the eye can move, but it can't enter another plane of existence. A solid barrier blocks the eye's movement, but the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1 inch in diameter.</effect>

        <effect>You create linked teleportation portals that remain open for the duration. Choose two points on the ground that you can see, one point within 10 feet of you and one point within 500 feet of you. A circular portal 10 feet in diameter opens over each point. If the portal would open in a space occupied by a creature, the spell fails and the casting is lost.
The portals are two dimensional glowing rings filled with mist, hovering inches from the ground and perpendicular to it at the points you choose. A ring is visible only from one side (your choice) which is the side that functions as a portal.
Any creature or object entering the portal exits from the other as if the two were adjacent to each other, passing through a portal from the non magical side has no effect. The mist that fills each portal is opaque and blocks vision through it. On your turn, you can rotate the rings as a bonus action so that the active side faces in a different direction.</effect>

You touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway and it becomes locked for the duration. You and the creatures you designate when you cast this spell can open the object normally. You can also set a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses the spell for 1 minute. Otherwise it is impassable until it is broken or the spell is suppressed or dispelled. Casting Knock on the object suppresses this spell for 10 minutes. While affected by this spell, the object is more difficult to break or force open. The DC to break it or pick any locks on it increases by 10.</effect>

        <effect>Material: For each creature you affect with this spell, you must provide one jacinth worth at least 1000 GP and one ornately carved bar of silver worth at least 100 GP, all of which the spell consumes.
You and up to eight willing creatures within range project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you are already on that plane). The material body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it doesn't need food or water or air and doesn't age.
Your astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way replicating your game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading into invisibility after 1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way home. If the cord is cut - something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it does - your soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.
Your astral form can freely travel through teh Astral Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter a new plane ore return to the plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane. Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it.
The spell ends for you and your companions when you use your action to dismiss it. When the spell ends the affected creature returns to its physical body and reawakens.
The spell might also end early for you or one of your companions. A successful Dispel Magic spell used against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that creature. If a creature's original body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the creature's astral form back to its material body, ending its state of suspended animation. If you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in their astral forms and must find their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping to 0 hit points.</effect>

By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes.

Weal - Good result

Weal and Woe - both good and bad results
Nothing - results that aren't especially good or bad
The spell doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome such as casting additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion. If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading.

You create a Large hand of shimmering, translucent force in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The hand lasts for the spell's duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements of your own hand.
The hand is an object that has AC20 and hit points equal to your hit point maximum. If it drops to O hit points, the spell ends. It has a Strength of 26 (+8)and a Dexterity of 10 (+0). The hand doesn't fill its space. When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following effects with it.
Clenched Fist: The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage.
Forceful Hand: The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose. Make a check with the hand's Strength contested by the Strength (Athletics) check of the target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting
ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it.
Grasping Hand: The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand's Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. While the hand is grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have the hand crush it. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier.
Interposing Hand: The hand interposes itself between you and a creature you choose until you give the hand a different command. The hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover against the target. The target can't move through the hand's space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the hand's Strength score. If its Strength score is higher than the hand's Strength score, the target can move toward you through the hand's space, but that space is difficuIt terrain for the target.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage from the clenched fist option increases by 2d8 and the damage from the grasping hand increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 5th.</effect>

On an 11 or higher, you vanish from your current plane of existence and appear in the Etheral Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you're already IN the Ethereal Plane). At the start of your next turn, and when the spell ends if you're in the Ethereal Plane, you return to an unoccupied space of your choice within 10 feet of the space you vanished from. If no unoccupied space is available within that range, you appear in the nearest unoccupied space (chosen at random if more than one space is equally near). You can dismiss the spell as an action.
While on the Ethereal Plane, you see and hear the plane you originated from, which is cast in shades of gray, and you can't see anything more than 60 feet away. You can only affect and be affected by other creatures on the Ethereal Plane. Creatures that aren't there can't perceive you or interact with you, unless they have the ability to do so.</effect>

        <effect>You cause up to six pillars of stone to burst from places on the ground that you can see within range. Each pillar is a cylinder that has a diameter of 5 feet and a height of up to 30 feet. The ground where the pillar appears must be wide enough for its diameter, and you can target the ground under a creature if that creature is Medium or smaller. Each pillar has an AC of 5 and 30 HP. When reduced to 0 HP, a pillar crumbles to rubble, which creates an area of difficult terrain with a 10 foot radius that lasts until it is cleared away. Each 5 foot diameter portion of the area requires 1 minute to clear by hand.
If a pillar is created under a creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity save or by lifted by that pillar. They can elect to fail the save.
If a pillar is prevented from reaching its full height because of a ceiling or other obstacle, a creature on the pillar takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage and is restrained, pinched between the pillar and the obstacle. The restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (target's choice) against the spell's save DC. On a success, the creature is no longer restrained and must either move off the pillar or fall off it.

The spell fails if you can't see a point in the air where the storm cloud could appear (for example, if you're in a room that can't accommodate the cloud).
When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see within range. A bolt of lightning flashes down from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity save. A creature takes 3d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to call down lightning in this way again, targeting the same point or a different one.
If you are outdoors in stormy conditions when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control over the existing storm instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the spells' damage increases by 1d10.

If a creature fails the save, choose one of the following two effects.
You can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or frightened. When this spell ends, any suppressed effect continues, provided that its duration didn't expire in the meantime.
Alternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed.

The object flies in a straight line up to 90 feet in a direction you choose before falling to the ground, stopping early if it impacts against a solid surface.

When the object strikes something, the object and what it strikes each take 3d8 bludgeoning damage.

        <effect>You hurl an undulating warbling mass of chaotic energy at one creature in range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8+1d6 damage. Choose one of the d8s. The number rolled on that die determines the attack's damage type, as shown below.

This spell grows an inert duplicate of a living creature as a safeguard against death. This clone forms inside a sealed vessel and grows to full size and maturity after 120 days; you can also choose to have the clone be a younger version of the same creature. It remains inert and endures indefinitely as long as the vessel remains undisturbed.
At any time after the clone matures, if the original creature dies, its soul transfers to the clone, provided that the soul is free and willing to return. The clone is physically identical to the original and has the same personality, memories, and abilities, but none of the equipment. The original creature's physical remains, if they still exist, become inert and can't thereafter be restored to life, since the creature's soul is elsewhere.</effect>

When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a Constitution save. The creature takes 5d8 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don't need to breathe. The fog moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns, rolling along the surface of the ground. The vapors, being heavier than air, sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down openings.

A dazzling array of flashing, colored light springs from your hand. Roll 6d10; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures in a 15 foot cone originating from you are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious and blind creatures).
Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell is blinded until the spell ends. Subtract each creature's hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points.

 - You instantaneously expand the flame 5 feet in one direction, provided that wood or other fuel is present in the new location.
 - You instantaneously extinguish the flames within the cube
 - you double or half the area of bright light and dim light cast by the flame, change its color, or both. The change lasts for 1 hour.

        <effect>You take control of the air in a 100 foot cube that you can see within range. Choose one of the following effects when you cast the spell. The effect lasts for the spell's duration, unless you use your action on a later turn to switch to a different effect. You can also use your action to temporarily halt the effect or to restart one you've halted.
Gusts: A wind picks up within the cube, continually blowing in a horizontal direction you designate. You choose the intensity of the wind: calm, moderate, or strong. If the wind is moderate or strong, ranged weapon attacks that enter or leave the cube or pass through it have disadvantage on their attack rolls. If the wind is strong, any creature moving against the wind must spend 1 extra foot of movement for each foot moved.
Downdraft: You cause a sustained blast of strong wind to blow downward from the top of the cube. Ranged weapon attacks that pass through the cube or that are made against targets within it have disadvantage on their attack rolls. A creature must make a Strength save if it flies into the cube for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there flying. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.
Updraft: You cause a sustained updraft within the cube, rising upward from the cube's bottom side. Creatures that end a fall within the cube take only half damage from the fall. When a creature in the cube makes a vertical jump, the creature can jump up to 10 feet higher than normal.</effect>

        <effect>You speak a one-word command to a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom save or follow the command on its next turn. The spell has no effect if the target is undead, if it doesn't understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it. Some typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a command other than one described here. If you do so the DM determines how the creature behaves. If the target can't follow your command, the spell ends.
Approach: The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.
Drop: The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.
Flee: The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means.
Grovel: The target falls prone and then ends its turn.
Halt: The target doesn't move and takes no actions. A flying creature stays aloft provided it is able to do so. If it must move to stay aloft, it flies the minimum distance needed to remain in the air.
Higher Spell Levels: +1 target per spell level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other.</effect>

Divine beings aren't necessarily omniscient, so you might receive "unclear" as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the deity's knowledge.

 - Terrain and bodies of water

 - Powerful celestials, fey, fiends, elementals, or undead

Each affected target must use as much of its movement as possible to move in that direction on its next turn. It can take its action before it moves. After moving in this way, it can make another Wisdom save to try to end the effect.

This spell assaults and twists the creatures' minds, spawning delusions and provoking uncontrolled action. Each creature in a 10 foot radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom save when you cast this spell or be affected by it. An affected target can't take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.
 d10 | Behavior
  1  | The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction, takes no action.
 2-6 | The creature doesn't move or take actions this turn.
 7-8 | The creature makes a melee attack against a random creature in reach, if any.
 9-10| The creature can move and act normally.
At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom save to end the effect.

You summon fey creatures that appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within range. Choose one of the following options for what appears.
 - 1 fey creature of CR 2 or lower
 - 2 fey creatures of CR 1 or lower
 - 4 fey creatures of CR 1/2 or lower

A fey creature summoned by this spell disappears when it drops to 0 HP or when the spell ends. The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for them as a group which has its own turns. They obey any verbal command you give them (no action required on your part). If you don't issue any commands to them they defend themselves against hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions. The DM has the creatures' statistics
Higher Spell Levels: Affected as follows.
6th level slot: Double the amount of creatures summoned.
8th level slot: Triple the amount of creatures summoned.</effect>

        <effect>You mentally contact a demigod, the spirit of a long dead sage, or some other mysterious entity from another plane. Contacting this extraplanar intelligence can strain or even break your mind. When you cast this spell, make a DC 15 Intelligence save. On a failure, you take 6d6 psychic damage and are insane until you finish a long rest. While insane, you can't take actions, can't understand what other people say, can't read, and speak only in gibberish. A greater restoration spell cast on you ends the effect.
On a successful save, you can ask the entity up to 5 questions. You must ask them before the spell ends. The DM answers each question with one word, such as "Yes", "No", "Maybe", "Never", "Irrelevant", or "Unclear" (if the entity doesn't know the answer to the question). If a one word answer would be misleading, the DM might instead offer a short phrase as an answer.</effect>

        <effect>Material: A statuette of yourself carved from ivory and decorated with gems worth at least 1500 GP.
Choose a spell of 5th level or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of 1 Action, and that can target you. You cast that spell, called the contingent spell, as part of casting contingency, expending the slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn't come into effect. Instead it takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You describe that circumstance when you cast the two spells. For example, "When I'm completely submerged in water, activate Water Breathing".
The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the circumstance is met for the first time, whether you want it to or not, and then contingency ends. The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You can only use one contingency spell at a time. If you cast this spell again the effect of the other contingency spell on you ends. Also, contingency ends on you if its material component is ever not on your person.</effect>

        <effect>Material: a drop of water and a pinch of dust.
Until the spell ends, you control any freestanding water inside an area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.
Flood: You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20 foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25% chance of capsizing.
The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.
Part Water: You cause the water in an area to move apart to create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.
Redirect Flow: You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves past the spells' area, it resumes its flow based on terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.
Whirlpool: This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making an Athletics check against your spell save DC.
When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts it turn there, it must make a Strength save. On a failure, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as above, but has disadvantage on the Athletics check to do so. The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, it takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.</effect>

When you cast the spell, you change the current weather conditions, which are determined by the DM based on the climate and season. You can change precipitation, temperature, and wind. it takes 1d4 times 10 minutes for the new conditions to take effect. Once they do so, you can change the conditions again.

You plant four pieces of nonmagical ammunition, arrows or crossbow bolts, in the ground within range and lay magic upon them to protect an area.

The creature must succeed on a Dexterity save or take 1d6 piercing damage. The piece of ammunition is then destroyed. The spell ends when no ammunition remains.

While speaking an intricate incantation, you cut yourself with a jewel-encrusted dagger, taking 2d4 piercing damage that can't be reduced in any way. You then drip your blood on the spell's other components and touch them, transforming them into a special construct called a homunculus.
The statistics of a homunculus are in the Monster Manual. It is your faithful companion, and it dies if you die. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can spend up to half your hit dice if the homunculus is on the same plane of existence as you. When you do so, roll each die and add your Constitution modifier to it. Your hit point maximum is reduced by this much and the homunculus's hit point maximum and current hit points are both increased by it. This process can reduce you to no lower than 1 HP, and the change to you and the homunculus's hit points ends when you finish your next long rest. The reduction to your hit point maximum can't be removed by any means before then, except by the homunculus' death.
You can only have one homunculus at a time. If you cast this spell while your homunculus lives, the spell fails.</effect>

You can cast this spell only at night. Choose up to three corpses of Medium or Small humanoids within range. Each corpse becomes a ghoul under your control. (The DM has game statistics for these creatures.)
As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can mentally command any creature you animated with this spell if the creature is within 120 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.
The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you have given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to three creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating new ones.
Higher Spell Levels: When you cast this spell using a 7th-leveI spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over four ghouls. When you cast this spell using an 8th-level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over five ghouls or two ghasts or wights.

You can also combine the four lights into one vaguely humanoid form of medium size. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds dim light in a 10 foot radius. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light created by this spell, and a light winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.</effect>

You decide whether it is a zombie or a skeleton (the statistics for both being in the Monster Manual), and it gains a bonus to its attack and damage rolls equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.
You can use a bonus action to mentally command the creatures you make with this spell, issuing the same command to all of them. To receive the command, a creature must be within 60 feet of you. You decide what action the creatures will take and where they will move during their next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a chamber or passageway against foes. If you issue no commands, the creatures do nothing except defend themselves against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creatures continue to follow it until their task is complete. The creatures are under your control until the spell ends, after which they become inanimate once more.

When the cylinder appears, each creature in it must make a Constitution save, taking 4d10 radiant damage on a failed save, and half as much on a success.

A beam of yellow light flashes from your pointing finger, then condenses to linger at a chosen point within range as a glowing bead for the duration. When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners. Each creature in a 20 foot radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity save. A creature takes fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success.
The spell's base damage is 12d6. If at the end of your turn the bead has not yet detonated, it increases by 1d6. If the glowing bead is touched before the interval has expired, the creature touching it must make a Dexterity save. On a failed save, the spell ends immediately, causing the bead to erupt in flame. On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet. When it strikes a creature or solid object, the spell ends and the bead explodes. The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried.

When opened, the door leads to a demiplane that appears to be an empty room 30 feet in each dimension made of wood or stone. When the spell ends the door disappears and any creatures or objects inside the demiplane remain trapped there, as the door also disappears from the other side.
Each time you cast this spell, you can create a new demiplane, or have a shadowy door connect to a demiplane you created with a previous casting of this spell. Additionally, if you know the nature and contents of a demiplane created by a casting of this spell by another creature, you can have the shadowy door connect to its demiplane instead.</effect>

        <effect>For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures, When you cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you, If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn't speak any language, the creature is unaffected.
You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature-what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature's thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature's mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature's thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.
Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation. You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can't see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you.
The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can't detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn't speak any language. Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can't see it, but it must still be within range.</effect>

        <effect>You make yourself - including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person - look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise the extent of the illusion is up to you.
The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects will pass right through it, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.
To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must make an Investigation check against your spell save DC.</effect>

A thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a target you can see within range. The target can be a creature, an object, or a creation of magical force, such as the wall created by wall of force.
A creature targeted by this spell must make a Dexterity save. On a failed save, the target takes 10d6+40 force damage. If this damage drops a target's HP to 0, it is disintegrated.
A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying save for magic items are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The creature can only be restored to life via a True Resurrection or Wish spell.
The spell automatically disintegrates a large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If the target is a huge or larger object or creation of force, this spell disintegrates a 10 foot cube portion of it. A magic item is unaffected by this spell.

Break Enchantment: As your action, you can touch a creature you can reach that is charmed, frightened, or possessed by a celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead. The creature you touch is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed by such creatures.
Dismissal: As your action, make a melee spell attack against a celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead you can reach. On a hit, you attempt to drive the creature back its home plane. The creature must succeed on a Charisma save or be sent back to its home plane if it isn't there already. If they aren't on their home plane, undead are sent to the Shadowfell and fey are sent to the Feywild.</effect>

        <effect>You utter a divine word, imbued with the power that shaped the world at the dawn of creation. Choose any number of creatures you can see within range. Each creature that can hear you must make a Charisma save. On a failed save, a creature suffers an effect based on its current hit points:
 - 50 HP or fewer: deafened for 1 minute
 - 40 HP or fewer: deafened and blinded for 10 minutes
 - 30 HP or fewer: deafened, blinded, and stunned for 1 hour
 - 20 HP or fewer: Dead.
Regardless of its current hit points, a celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend that fails its save is forced back to its plane of origin if it's not there already and can't return to your current plane for 24 hours by any means short of a wish spell.</effect>

        <effect>You attempt to beguile a beast that you can see within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.
While the beast is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as "Attack that creature." "Run over there," or "Fetch that object." If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.
You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use our own reaction as well.
Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.

You invoke the spirits of nature to protect an area outdoors or underground. The area can be as small as a 30 foot cube or as large as a 90 foot cube. Buildings and other structures are excluded from this area. If you cast this spell in the same area every day for a year, the spell lasts until dispelled.
The spell creates the following effects within the area. When you cast this spell, you can specify creatures as friends who are immune to the effects. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.
The entire warded area radiates magic. A dispel magic cast on the area, if successful, removes only one of the following effects, not the entire area. The spell's caster chooses which effect to end. Only when all of its effects are gone is this spell dispelled.
Solid Fog: You can fill any number of 5 foot squares on the ground with thick fog, making them heavily obscured. The fog reaches 10 feet high. In addition, every foot of movement through the fog costs 2 extra feet. To a creature immune to this effect, the fog obscures nothing and looks like soft mist, with motes of green light floating through the air.
Grasping Undergrowth: You can fill any number of 5 foot squares on the ground that aren't filled with fog with grasping weeds and vines, as if they were affected by the entangle spell. To a creature immune to this effect, the weeds and vines feel soft and reshape themselves to serve as temporary seats or beds.
Grove Guardians: You can animate up to four trees in the area, causing them to uproot themselves from the ground. These trees have the same stats as an awakened tree which appears in the Monster Manual, except they can't speak and their bark is covered with druidic symbols. If any creature not immune to this effect enters the area, the grove guardians fight until they have driven off or slain the intruders. The grove guardians also obey your spoken commands (no action required by you) that you issue while in the area. If you don't give them commands and no intruders are present, they do nothing. The grove guardians can't leave the warded area. When the spell ends, the magic animating them disappears, and the trees take root again if possible.
Additional Spell Effect: You can place your choice of one of the following magical effects within the warded area.
 - A constant gust of wind spell in two locations of your choice.
 - Spike growth in one location of your choice
 - Wind wall in two locations of your choice
To a creature immune to this effect, the winds are a fragrant, gentle breeze, and the area of spike growth is harmless.</effect>

This spell shapes a creature's dreams. Choose a creature known to you as the target of this spell. The target must be on the same plane of existence as you. Creatures that don't sleep, such as elves, can't be contacted by this spell. You, or a willing creature you touch, enters a trance state, acting as a messenger. While in the trance, the messenger is aware of his or her surroundings, but can't take actions or move.
If the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the target's dreams and can converse with the target as long as it remains asleep, through the duration of the spell. The messenger can also shape the environment of the dream, creating landscapes. objects, and other images. The messenger can emerge from the trance at any time, ending the effect of the spell early. The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it, and can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to fall asleep, at which point the messenger appears in the target's dreams.
You can make the messenger appear monstrous and terrifying to the target. If you do, the messenger can deliver a message of no more than ten words and then the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, echoes of the phantasmal monstrosity spawn a nightmare that lasts the duration of the target's sleep and prevents the target from gaining any benefit from that rest. In addition, when the target wakes up, it takes 3d6 psychic damage. If you have a body part, lock of hair, c1ipping from a nail, or similar portion of the target's body, the target makes its saving throw with disadvantage.</effect>

On a success, they take half damage and aren't pushed.
As a bonus action, you can move the dust devil up to 30 feet in any direction. If the dust devil moves over sand, dust, loose dirt, or light gravel, it sucks up the material and forms a 10 foot radius cloud of debris around itself that lasts until the start of your next turn, which heavily obscures the area.

You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you can see within range. For the duration an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 100 foot radius circle centered on that point and shakes creatures and structures in contact with the ground in that area.
The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain . Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a Constitution saving throw, on a failed save, the creature's concentration is broken.
When you cast this spell and at the end of each turn you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity save. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone. This spell can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the DM
Fissures: Fissures open throughout the spells' area at the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the DM. Each is 1d10 X 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the spell's area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity save or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves alongside the fissure opening. One which opens directly under a building causes it to immediately collapse.
Structures: The tremors deal 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 HP, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure's height must make a Dexterity save. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in rubble, requiring a DC 20 Athletics check as an action to escape. The DM can adjust the DC higher or lower depending on the makeup of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and doesn't fall prone or become buried.</effect>

You cause a creature or object you can see within range to grow larger or smaller for the duration. Choose either a creature or an object that is not worn or carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Constitution save. On a success, the spell has no effect. If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once.
Enlarge: The target's size doubles in all dimensions and its weight is multiplied by 8. This growth increases its size by one category. If there isn't enough room for the target to double its size, the creature attains the maximum possible size in the space allowed. Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saves. The target's weapons grow to match its new size. While these weapons are enlarged, the target's attacks with them deal 1d4 extra damage.
Reduce: The target's size is halved in all dimensions and its weight is divided by 8. This reduction decreases its size by one category. Until the spell ends, the target also has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saves. The target's weapons also shrink to fit the new size. While these weapons are reduced, the target's attacks deal 1d4 less damage, to a minimum of 1 damage.</effect>

        <effect>You step into the border regions of the Ethereal Plane, in the area where it overlaps with your current plane. You remain in the Border Ethereal for the duration or until you use your action to dismiss the spell. During this time you can move in any direction. If you move up or down, every foot of movement costs an extra foot. You can see and hear the plane you originated from, but everything there looks gray, and you can't see anything more than 60 feet away.
While on the Ethereal Plane, you can only affect or be affected by other creatures on that plane. Creatures that aren't on the Ethereal Plane can't perceive you and can't interact with you unless a special ability or magic has given them the ability to do so.
You ignore all objects and effects that aren't on the Ethereal Plane, allowing you to move through objects you perceive on the plane you originated from.
When the spell ends, you immediately return to the plane you originated from in the spot you currently occupy. If you occupy the same spot as a solid object or creature when this happens, you're immediately shunted to the nearest open spot and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you moved.
This spell has no effect if you cast it while you're on the Ethereal Plane or a plane that doesn't border it, such as one of the Outer Planes.

When a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Dexterity save or take 3d6 bludgeoning damage and be restrained by the tentacles until the spell ends. A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already restrained by the tentacles takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage. A creature restrained by the tentacles can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On success, they free themselves.</effect>

One creature of your choice within 60 feet of you that you can see must succeed on a Wisdom save or be affected by one of the effects of your choice below for the duration. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to target another creature but can't target a creature again if it has succeeded on a saving throw against this casting of eyebite.
Asleep: the target falls unconscious. It wakes up if it takes any damage or if another creature uses its action to shake the sleeper awake.
Panicked: The target is frightened of you.

        <effect>Material: 10 gp worth of charcoal, incense, and herbs that must be consumed by fire in a brass brazier
You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you choose: bat, cat, crab, frog (toad), hawk, lizard, octopus, owl, poisonous snake, fish (quipper), rat, raven, sea horse, spider, or weasel. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.
Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.
When the familiar drops to O hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again.
While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.
As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar. It disappears into a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.
You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.
Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.</effect>

Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the spirit takes on a form you choose: a griffon, a pegasus, a peryton, a dire wolf, a rhinoceros, or a saber—toothed tiger. The creature has the statistics provided in the Monster Manual for the chosen form, though it is a celestial, a fey, or a fiend (your choice) instead of its normal creature type. Additionally, if it has an Intelligence score of 5 or lower, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.
You control the mount in combat. While the mount is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it te1epathically. While mounted on it, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target the mount.
The mount disappears temporarily when it drops to 0 hit points or when you dismiss it as an action. Casting this spell again re—summons the bonded mount, with all its hit points restored and any conditions removed.
You can’t have more than one mount bonded by this spell or find steed at the same time. As an action, you can release a mount from its bond, causing it to disappear permanently. Whenever the mount disappears, it leaves behind any objects it was wearing or carrying.</effect>

Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the steed takes on a form that you choose, such as a warhorse, a pony, a camel, an elk, or a mastiff. (Your DM might allow other animals to be summoned as steeds.) The steed has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of its normal type. Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.
Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.
When the steed drops to O hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum.
While your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. You can't have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time. As an action, you can release the steed from its bond at any time, causing it to disappear.</effect>

While you are traveling there, whenever you're presented with a choice of paths along the way, you automatically determine which is the shortest and most direct route (but not necessarily the safest) to the destination.</effect>

        <effect>You sense the presence of any trap within range that is within line of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus the spell would sense an alarm spell, a glyph of warding, or a mechanical pit trap, but it wouldn't reveal a natural weakness in the floor, a sinkhole, or an unstable ceiling.
This spell merely reveals a trap is present. You don't learn the location of each trap, but you do learn the general nature of the dangers posed by the traps you detect.</effect>

The flames provide you with a warm shield or a chill shield as you choose. The warm shield gives you resistance to cold damage, and the chill shield resistance to fire damage.
In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits with a melee attack, the shield erupts with flame. The attacker takes 2d8 fire damage from a warm shield, or 2d8 cold from the chill shield.</effect>

A 5 foot diameter sphere of fire appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within range and lasts for the duration. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere must make a Dexterity save. The creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.
As a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet. If you ram the sphere into a creature, that creature must make the saving throw against the sphere's damage, and the sphere stops moving this turn.
When you move the sphere, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. The sphere ignites flammable objects not worn or carried, and it sheds bright light in a 20 foot radius, and dim light for another 20 feet.

You attempt to turn one creature that you can see within range into stone. If the target's body is made of flesh, the creature must make a Constitution save. On a failed save, it is restrained as its flesh begins to harden.
A creature restrained by this spell must make another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves against the spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails three times, it's turned to stone and subject to the Petrified condition for the duration. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive - effectively it's a form of death saves that don't result in death.
If the creature is physically broken while petrified, it suffers from similar deformities if it reverts to its original state. If you maintain your concentration on this spell for the entire possible duration, the creature is turned to stone until the effect is removed.</effect>

You create a ward against magical travel that protects up to 40,000 square feet of floor space to a height of 30 feet above the floor. For the duration, creatures can't teleport into the area or use portals, such as those created by the Gate spell, to enter the area. The spell proofs the area against planar travel, and therefore prevents creatures from accessing the area by way of the Astral Plane, Ethereal Plane, Feywild, Shadowfell, or the plane shift spell.
In addition, the spell damages types of creatures that you choose when you cast it. Choose one or more of the following: Celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. When a chosen creature enters the spells area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature takes 5d10 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice when you cast this spell).
When you cast this spell, you can designate a password. A creature that speaks the password as it enters the area takes no damage from the spell.
The spell's area can't overlap with the area of another forbiddance spell. If you cast forbiddance every day for 30 days in the same location, the spell lasts until it is dispelled,and the material components are consumed on the last casting.</effect>

An immobile, invisible, cube shaped prison composed of magical force springs into existence around an area you choose within range. The prison can be a cage or a solid box as you choose.
A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20 feet on a side and is made from 1/2 diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart.
A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any spells cast into or out from the area.
When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the cage's area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside it, are pushed away from the center until they are completely outside the area. A creature inside the cage can't leave it by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma save. On success the creature can use that magic to escape the cage. On a failure, they can't exit the cage and waste the use of the spell or effect. The cage also extends into the Ethereal Plane, and can't be dispelled by dispel magic.</effect>
